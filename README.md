# OpenWeatherMapDemo
My demo for using open weather map API for iOS app.
OpenWeatherMap provides a great API to be used for apps. I have created a demo which uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather forecast of cities based on cityname or coordinates.
The app provides two tabs. In the first tab(Step 1) user can insert city names and then press done to view forecast for the cities for the next 14 days. In the second tab user's location is tracked and then user can press button to reveal forecast for his current location.
